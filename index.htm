Well, it's actually more...

---
### - Open source (github.com/watch-devtube)

--

### - Channel curation via GitHub (github.com/watch-devtube/contrib)

--

### - All data is mutable 
???
your name is mistyped by a conf organiser

--

### - No marketing videos

--

### - Better ranking (bit.ly/how_we_rank)

--

### - Better UX and search (thanks to community)

## Front-End

---

- simple, easy to understand, easy to start with
- routing and state management

# ES6 with Babel

class: invert
background-image: url(bulma.png)
background-size: contain
???
- no javascript
- super nice

---
class: firebase
background-image: url(firebase.png)
background-size: contain
???
- authentication (github, twitter, google)
- firestore, document storage as a service (subscriptions, favorites, watched)
- Pay as go you. Limits are generous. We go and don't pay.

---

## Back-End

---
class: invert
background-image: url(algolia.png)
background-size: contain
???
- Serverless, SaaS algolia (~elastic search as a service)
- Algolia had OSS plan and, according to our convo, I understood it's free for OSS. No limits.

.fire[![](fire.png)]
???
- And then everything went on fire... Limits!

# **Free is a lie.**

### @eduardsi: We have become popular. Please provide us with 5M free records!

--

### @algolia: We won't be able to give you 5M operations for free. The 300k operations you have is already more than what we usually give for open-source. I'll bump it to 400k so you can enjoy your Hacker News ride, but I won't be able to do much more unfortunately. What I can do though is to hook you up with our sales team if you'd like. 

--

### @eduardsi: Thanks! Please send us the quote.
???
- at this point it was evident we can't pay and have to move away.
- but we had to pretend we are willing to pay.

# express.js + Google Cloud Functions
???
- no time and money for managing servers.
- GCF reached GA only in July, 2018. Now it's less stable than in BETA :))

---
class: center, middle
# Why not AWS?
???
- Direct Express.js API support vs. API gateway magic
- Easy to use, no access rights magic
- No PhD in computer science.

---
# What can replace Algolia in long-term?

--

### - Elasticsearch
???
- self-hosted (servers)
- managed ($$$)

--

### - Elasticsearch

### - Lunr.js (github.com/olivernn/lunr.js) + Loki.js (github.com/techfort/LokiJS)

look ma, no servers! code + data is deployed as single lambda fn.

---
class: center, middle
# Seriously, no servers?
???
Well, ok, there is one.

---
class: center, middle
# **Nginx**
???
- cheaper than Google Cloud LB
- f1-micro instance, less memory than Raspberry PI and only once CPU
- handling huge traffic and no busy at all : )

---
class: center, middle, danger
# **Cold starts**
???
- 5-10 seconds
- solution: CDN for statics, progress bar! split function in smaller.

---
class: center, middle, danger
# **Downtimes**
???
- no zero downtime deployments in GCF
- aws wins here
- we implemented blue-green. We have 2 versions, then check if app is alive, then switch nginx.

---
class: center, middle, danger
# **Case-by-case test automation**
???
- we do not have the luxury of time to auto-test everything.
- autotest things that it's hard / annoying / expensive to tests manually (ranking)
- autotest critical scenarios (e.g. where bugs can lead to data corruption)
- No test env, so we deploy and TiP
- focus on MTTD / MTTR (errors go to Slack, PingDom)

---
class: center, middle
# **How much does it cost?**
???
- burn rate 20$
- 300$ from Google
- dev time, but have amazing contributors, including famous IT peeps. See â€“
