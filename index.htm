### @eduardsi: We are facing extremely high load. Please provide us with 5M free records!

--

### @algolia: We won't be able to give you 5M operations for free. The 300k operations you have is already more than what we usually give for open-source. I'll bump it to 400k so you can enjoy your Hacker News ride, but I won't be able to do much more unfortunately. What I can do though is to hook you up with our sales team if you'd like.

### @eduardsi: Thanks! Please send us the quote.
